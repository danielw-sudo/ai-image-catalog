> A radical race car from tomorrow's circuits rockets through dual
> realities of speed. The vehicle itself is a masterpiece of aggressive
> aerodynamics—sharp angular lines, impossibly low profile, glowing energy
> accents cutting through space. Above, golden concentric rings pulse past
> like digital heartbeats. Below and behind, the world shatters into pure
> chromatic chaos: turquoise bleeds into electric pink, violet, orange—the
> car's wake painting rainbow fractals across reality. Sleek carbon-fibre
> surfaces catch both the warm ceiling glow and cool cyan tunnel light.
> This machine doesn't just race; it tears through dimensions, leaving
> trails of liquid light where physics used to be.
