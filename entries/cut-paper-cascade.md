> Waves of meticulously cut paper cascade across this sculptural portrait
> where Art Deco elegance meets contemporary craft. A woman in profile
> tilts her face skyward, red lips parted, porcelain skin framed by
> swirling hair rendered in blues, grays, and midnight black. Each strand
> is individual layered paper with visible ridges catching light. Orange
> flames billow behind her like sunset clouds. A black cat with piercing
> yellow eyes nestles against her chest, fur detailed in precision cuts.
> Everything is depth and dimension—shadows between layers create the
> form.
